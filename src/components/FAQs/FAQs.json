    "answers": [
      "With Stacks 2.0x, it can happen that Bitcoin transactions can't be verified on the Stacks blockchain due to so-called flash blocks. These Bitcoin blocks were not mined by Stacks miners and they are not visible to the Stacks blockchain. This changes with Stacks 2.1. Therefore, only use these swaps with users that you trust to resolve such a case off-chain."

      "- When finalizing the swap, you could have used the wrong swap id. <br/>**Check all details when signing the transaction!**.<br/> The swap can be canceled after 100 blocks. Therefore, make sure that the swap is finalized before. Use a suitable fee."
